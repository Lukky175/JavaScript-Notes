/*
In a String Sometimes there are Characters that we want in string to be printed as it is e.g " ", or ' ', But these may interfere with our
main String thus we are introduced to Escape Sequence Characters, We can use '\' before the Character we want to write

eg: 
\n - New Line
\t = Tab
\r - Carriage return */

let a = "This is a Sentence\nHow are You\tI hope you are \"Fine\" ";
console.log(a)
